üì∏ Context Lens - AI Visual Explainer
Context Lens is a responsive web application that uses your device's camera and the power of the Google Gemini API to identify and explain anything you point it at. Turn your world into an interactive encyclopedia!

üåü About The Project
Have you ever looked at a landmark, a plant, or a piece of art and wished you could instantly know its story? Context Lens bridges that gap. This application captures a live image from your camera, sends it to Google's advanced multimodal AI, and displays a rich, detailed explanation in real-time. It's a simple yet powerful demonstration of the capabilities of modern generative AI.

This project was built to be:

Simple: Contained in a single HTML file with no complex dependencies or build steps.

Modern: Utilizes a clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.

Powerful: Directly integrates with the Google Gemini API for state-of-the-art visual analysis.

‚ú® Features
Real-Time Camera Access: Uses the rear-facing camera (environment) on mobile devices for easy pointing.

AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 model for fast and accurate image understanding.

Responsive Design: A beautiful and intuitive interface that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile browsers.

Loading & Error States: Clear UI feedback while the AI is processing or if an error occurs.

Zero Dependencies: Runs directly in the browser with no installation required, using only a CDN for Tailwind CSS.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Core AI: Google Gemini API

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application's logic is straightforward:

The browser's navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia API is used to access the device's video camera.

The live video is streamed to an HTML <video> element.

When the "Analyze" button is clicked, a single frame from the video stream is drawn onto a hidden <canvas> element.

The canvas image is converted to a Base64-encoded JPEG string.

A fetch request is made to the Gemini API, sending the image data along with a carefully crafted prompt.

The AI's text response is parsed and displayed in the explanation panel.
